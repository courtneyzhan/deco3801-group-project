	Timeline -> time to work on it, 

## Notes from Thurs Meeting
### Project Spec:
* Mood Review over time will likely be an issue
	* Key considerations: How to format in Monthly, Weekly is probably doable, but a lot to consider for Monthly
	* Given that mood is on a 5-point scale, can use a line graph and extend the domain (dates) -> easy but not as spec envisioned
* Choosing not to do customisable layouts

### Project Implementation
* Tools and Frameworks (undecided, see below)
* [Single-Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)

### Team 
* Role allocation (very flexible) complete. My roles as of 5-Aug:
	* Front-end (A + WY + WW)
	* DB (WY)
	* Automated Testing (V + J, but they are probably manual testers ?)
	* If needed I can also help with Backend for Posts (V + J)

### Things to Keep an Eye On
* [Trello](https://trello.com/newplayerw17/members)
	* Probably don't need at think about this except during meetings
* Github
	* Not yet set up, but I'll probably get an email when it is

## For Sunday's Meeting
1. Decide tools/technologies/frameworks
From discussion in Week 1, should be language everyone is familiar with. i.e. Python/Java back-end with a standard front-end. 
Suggestions brought up in the meeting:

* Backend (Models/Controllers)
	* Django
	* Flask
	* Rails
* Database
	* SQLite
* Front-end (Views)
	* Standard HTML/CSS/JS
	* React
	* Standard + TypeScript in favour of JS
	**Respectfully disagree if tech chosen is unfair/unreasonable. Make sure EVERYONE is comfortable** 
* Testing
	* No one mentioned this... 

2. Complete Statement of Work
	a. Project Milestones
	b. Sign-off Criteria (?) What constitutes as a complete item ;;
	c. Get people to compress team skills, space conservation
	d. Fix Risk Table, resize columns. 2nd row remove trailing comma.
	e. Remove line breaks between Proposal
3. Upload relevant files to MS Teams for filekeeping because #resources is super messy and there are so many repeat files
3. Decide to leave or not
