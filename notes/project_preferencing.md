## Project 17
**Team:** Team Flash Squad  
**Project Name:** UQ Carpooling App  
**Description:**  
Upload UQ Timetable, find which students travel to same class at same time along similar route and carpool
Passengers get rewards for pooling
Drivers get rewards for being a driver (free parking, discounts etc), which is outside of the app I suppose (?)

**Technical Difficulties**  

* Route finding
  Looks like can filter by same start time and same precinct (group buildings into their respective precincts)
  Problem would then be route finding with multiple waypoints (passengers pick up location)
* Connecting to UQ Timetable
  Unless the uqcloud can also access student timetabling
* Rewards System
  Imagine not too difficult, use as a substitute for money

## Project 59
**Team:** Team WLS  
**Project Name:** Aging Population - How to Prevent the Social Isolation and Loneliness of the Elderly  
**Description:**  
Essentially a public event board that is extremely user friendly and user adaptable (font/colour contrast)
Events are:

* Online (not hosted by the site though, provide some zoom link or w/e)
* Offline (physical location)
  - In this case, recommended by location

Users can: 

* Create events
* View events
* Book events
* Favourite events

Events have:

* Group chat of all that are booked in
* Tags

??? some out of place requirements like wearable technology that will alert emergency services if an accident occurs but seems a bit far fetched as it is a social based app not an emergency monitoring one ;;

**Technical Difficulties**  
Key: groupchat for event; would need users to be apart of a group, and if there are 2 or more users, a chat needs to be created, then destroyed some time (x) after the event is scheduled to conclude.  
Creating an event and booking into it should not be a problem though  
If the tutors make us do the wearable technology aspect that would be a bit odd... though likely not too challenging, will be time-consuming

## Project 22
**Team:** GPA6plus1  
**Project Name:** The Elderly Community  
**Description**  
A very very simplified version of Project 59! Only an event board, where you may sign up to existing events only.
The difference in the event system is that, the event organiser and a personal account are separate, whereas in Prj59 any user may create an event.
Literally 2 basic CRUD systems ;;;;;;;; hard to show complexity though ;;

**Technical Difficulties**  
Creating an event and booking into it should not be a problem though  
Creating two user different user bases may be a problem, but they would just be child class with higher perms of a 'basic' user.

  Essentially a shortest path algorithm with multiple stops
- Difficulty
  * Basically a shortest path
  * Need multiple sides,business side as well as deliveryside
  * Quite a lot to consider
