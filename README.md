DECO3801 Notes and Personal Tests of Frameworks(NOT the real group project)

## Purpose
Purpose: Spikes on Django, Flutter, React Native to see which one would be easy to pick up/use for mobile application  
Objective for Each Spike: Get CRUD working for a post/diary entry system  
  
Additional Requirements:
- Django, use Daisy UI to test this CSS Framework
- Django, get to full PWA, most importantly, working offline (Wilson's concern)
- Flutter & React Native, how to build and deploy final product
  -  How to test on mobile (?) Appium ?

### Django & Daisy UI
Trying basic Django App with Daisy UI  
**Complete**: 02-Aug-2021  
**Thoughts**: 
* (-) The routing system is a bit convoluted to get the hang of initially.
* (-) Not a huge fan of the querying system, but maybe a better way exists (similar to ActiveRecord ?)
* (-) Daisy UI Looks really nice, but becomes very difficult to read. Better off sticking to Bootstrap or MaterializeCSS
* (+) Functionality (called apps) are isolated which is good. 
* (+) Python which is familiar to all members
* (+) A lot of tutorials and guides exist
* TODO implement PWA Offline Functionality [Helpful Resource Link](https://medium.com/beginners-guide-to-mobile-web-development/convert-django-website-to-a-progressive-web-app-3536bc4f2862)
