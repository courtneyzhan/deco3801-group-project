DECO3801 Notes and Personal Tests of Frameworks(NOT the real group project)

Purpose: Spikes on Django, Flutter, React Native 
Get CRUD working for a post/diary entry system

## Django & Daisy UI
Trying basic Django App with Daisy UI
Complete: 02-Aug-2021
Verdict -> The routing system is a bit convoluted to get the hang of initially -> functionality (called apps) are isolated which is good. TODO try to convert to PWA.

## Flutter

## React Native
